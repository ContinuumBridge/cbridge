The ContinuumBridge platform enables anyone to connect wireless devices to a Raspberry Pi or similar device and write apps that use them. The key benefits of this are:

* You own and control your devices and decide who else you are going to allow to access them.
* Developers can write apps that work in the same way, regardless of how the devices are connected (eg: Bluetooth, Z-Wave, ZigBee or WiFi).
* Anyone can write an app and put it in the ContinuumBridge app market.
